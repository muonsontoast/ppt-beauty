This script generates a slideshow template in MS Powerpoint for Mac with a dynamic slide indicator, slide counter, title slide including abstract, content slides and qr code. A set of nice colour schemes is defined and can be referenced from within the script to change the colour scheme of the whole template.

To run the script and generate a template: 
  1. Open Powerpoint
  2. Create as many blank slides as you'll need (including one for the title slide)
  3. Open the Apple Script file.
  4. Run the script.

Additionally, specify a file path to a qr code, which will be populated on the title slide.

To rerun the script and generate a new template:
  Delete every slide and recreate the blank slides, which can be done quickly by copying all the blank slides the first time you make them and copy-pasting     OR     Ctrl+Z to undo changes

Rerunning the script will populate the new elements over the old ones if they exist. This is fine if you are only adjusting the colour, otherwise there will be text overlay issues. I recommend clearing all slides if doing anything other than changing colour, as above.
