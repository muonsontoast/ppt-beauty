This script generates a slideshow template in MS Powerpoint for Mac with a dynamic slide indicator, slide counter, title slide, qr code, titles and abstract. A set of nice colour schemes have been defined and can be referenced from within the script to change the colour scheme of the whole template.

To run the script: 
  1. Open Powerpoint
  2. Create as many blank slides as you'll need (including one for the title slide)
  3. Open the Apple Script file.
  4. Run the script.

Additionally, specify a file path to a qr code, which will be populated on the title slide.
